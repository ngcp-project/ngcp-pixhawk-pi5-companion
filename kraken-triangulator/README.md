# KrakenSDR Triangulator Web App

A professional **laptop-side** web application designed for verifying KrakenSDR bearing estimates and performing advanced signal-source triangulation. This tooling is built specifically for Commander laptops during NGCP UAV signal-hunting operations.

> **Note:** This runs on the ground station laptop — not the Raspberry Pi 5. It is self-contained and operates independently of the Pi-side GCS telemetry pipeline.

## What This Does

1. **Ingests Bearing Estimates:** Receives live data from KrakenSDR receiver networks or replays localized historical `.json` files.
2. **Advanced Triangulation Math:** Computes the estimated target origin using two distinct mathematical modes:
   - **Bayesian Spatial Heatmap:** A probability-density field generated from accumulated intersection uncertainties.
   - **Least Squares Angle-of-Arrival (LS-AoA):** A rigid matrix-solver designed for clean, intersecting geometries.
3. **Interactive Spatial Filtering:** Features UI-driven spatial masking tools ("Draw Area" and "Draw Polygon") to dynamically filter out rogue bearings, reflections, or corrupted data physically tracking outside a designated zone.
4. **Professional GUI:** Displays real-time results on an interactive map (Leaflet.js) sporting a dark, premium, utilitarian aesthetic with Playback console controls, a bearing log, and customizable mapping layers.

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these step-by-step commands to get the application running on your local machine using the built-in playback data environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the main project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanPastor/NGCP-Kraken-Triangulator-App.git
cd NGCP-Kraken-Triangulator-App/kraken-triangulator
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
The application relies on a lightweight Python server (Flask) to handle spatial mathematics and serve the frontend interface. You need Python 3.8+ installed.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Application Server
Run the Python backend server. By default, it will automatically load a dense, pre-recorded mock dataset (`data/bearings_20260313_154333.json`) so you can test the triangulation math immediately.
```bash
python server/kraken_server.py
```
*The server will boot up and bind to **http://localhost:5050**.*

### 4. Open the Web App
Open any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and navigate to:
```url
http://localhost:5050
```
You are now in the app! Use the **Data Playback** console at the top to hit **Play (▶)** and watch the historical triangulation happen in real-time.

## Live Hardware Integration

When you are ready to connect a live KrakenSDR unit instead of using Playback data, invoke the server by passing the Kraken's API URL as an environment variable:

**Linux / Mac:**
```bash
KRAKEN_API_URL=http://<kraken-ip-address>:8080 python server/kraken_server.py
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:KRAKEN_API_URL="http://<kraken-ip-address>:8080"
python server/kraken_server.py
```
